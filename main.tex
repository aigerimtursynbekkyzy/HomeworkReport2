\noindent Five cards are dealt from a standard 52-card deck. What is the probability that the sum of the faces on the five cards is 48 or more?


\subsection*{Question 2, Section 2, Chapter 2 (\cite{boyce11th})}

\noindent\textbf{Assigned to Zhannur Kazenov}\\

\noindent Dana is not the worldâ€™s best poker player. Dealt a 2 of diamonds, an 8 of diamonds, an ace of hearts, an ace of clubs, and an ace of spades, she discards the three aces. What are her chances of drawing to a flush?

\subsection*{Question 3, Section 2, Chapter 2 (\cite{boyce11th})}

\noindent\textbf{Assigned to Alina Abdrakhmanova}\\

\noindent Tim is dealt a 4 of clubs, a 6 of hearts, an 8 of hearts, a 9 of hearts, and a king of diamonds. He discards the 4 and the king. What are his chances of drawing to a straight flush? To a flush?


\subsection*{Question 4, Section 2, Chapter 2 (\cite{boyce11th})}

\noindent\textbf{Assigned to Akbota Assainova}\\

A poker player is dealt a 7 of diamonds, a queen of diamonds, a queen of hearts, a queen of clubs, and an ace of hearts. He discards the 7. What is his probability of drawing to either a full house or four-of-a-kind?


\subsection*{Question 5, Section 2, Chapter 2 (\cite{boyce11th})}

\noindent\textbf{Assigned to Dariya Kalymova}\\

\noindent A bridge hand (thirteen cards) is dealt from a stan dard 52-card deck. Let A be the event that the hand contains four aces; let B be the event that the hand contains four kings. Find

\section*{Solutions}

\subsection*{Question 1, Section 2, Chapter 2  (\cite{boyce11th})}

\noindent\textbf{Assigned to Dina Kalibekova}\\

\noindent The number of ways that five cards are dealt from a standard 52-card deck is:
$$
    C=\frac{52!}{5!(52-5)!}= 2598960
$$
4 cards which contain the number 10 and one card which contains 9:
$$
    (1\times4)+(4\times6)+(4\times1)=32
$$
The probability that the sum of the faces on the five cards is 48 or more is:
$$
   P(Sum \ \ is \ \ 48 \ \ or \ \ more) = \frac{m}{n} = \frac{32}{2598960},$$
\newline
where m - The number of ways of selecting the sum of the faces and n - Total number of ways
\newline
Therefore, the probability that the sum of the faces on the five cards is 48 or more is:

    $$\frac{32}{2598960}$$

\subsection*{Question 2, Section 2, Chapter 2 (\cite{boyce11th})}

\noindent\textbf{Assigned to Zhannur Kazenov}\\

\noindent To get a flush, Dana needs to draw any 3 of the remaining 11 diamonds. Since only 47 cards are effectively left in the deck (others may already have been dealt, but their identities are unknown), 
\newline P(Dana draws to flush) = P(A)
\[
    P(A) =\frac{\binom{11}{3}}{\binom{47}{3}}=0.0101758
\]
\subsection*{Question 3, Section 2, Chapter 2 (\cite{boyce11th})}

\noindent\textbf{Assigned to Alina Abdrakhmanova}\\

\noindent Tim is dealt a 4 of a clubs, 8 of hearts, 9 of hearts, and king of diamonds. So, he has been dealt 5 cards and there are 47 cards remaining in the deck. To get a straight flush, Tim needs to have all the cards of the same suit and in sequence. He has 3 hearts in hand that can be made into sequence if 7 of hearts is added to it. Then another 1 card is needed (either 5 or 10 of hearts). \newline
7 of hearts can be drawn in \begin{equation}
    \binom{1}{1}
\end{equation} ways. \newline
Any of 5 or 10 of hearts can be drawn in \begin{equation}
    \binom{2}{1}
\end{equation} ways. \newline
Let A be an event that a straight flush is drawn. \newline
Then probability of it happening is: \begin{equation}
    P(A) =\frac{\binom{1}{1}\binom{2}{1}}{\binom{47}{2}}
\end{equation} \newline
To get a flush, which is when all cards are of the same suit and not necessarily in sequence, Tim needs to choose 2 more cards from of hearts. He can do it in $\binom{10}{2}$ ways. It includes 2 cards that will make a sequence a \textbf{straight flush}. So total number of ways to get a flush is $\binom{10}{2}-2$. \newline
Let B be an event that flush is drawn.
Then probability of it happening is: \begin{equation}
    P(A) =\frac{\binom{10}{2}-2}{\binom{47}{2}}
\end{equation}
\subsection*{Question 4, Section 2, Chapter 2 (\cite{boyce11th})}

\noindent\textbf{Assigned to Akbota Assainova}\\

\noindent Firstly, let's discuss about the cases of full house or four-of-a-kind to solve this problem. 
\newline 
\textbf{Four of kind:} 
a hand where four of the cards are with the same rank and another one with different rank. \textit{Example:} $K\varheartsuit, K\spadesuit, K\clubsuit, K\vardiamondsuit, A\vardiamondsuit$
\newline
\textbf{full house:} 
 a hand of 5 cards representing two cards with the same rank and another three cards with another same rank. \textit{Example:} $Q\varheartsuit, Q\spadesuit, Q\clubsuit, K\spadesuit, K\clubsuit$ 
\newline
Now, we can solve the problem itself.
\newline
There are 52 cards in a deck, 4 of each type.
The poker playeralina.abdra16@gmail.com has 5 cards, leaving 47 in the deck.
To get a full house he needs one more ace. there are 3 left in the deck.
To get a 4 of a kind he needs one more queen. there is only one left in the deck.
\newline
There are 3 aces, so three of those circumstances. there are 47 cards remaining in the deck, so there is a total of 47 circumstances. the probability of a full house is $P_{full house}=\frac{3}{47}$.
\newline
The same thing applies to the four-of-a-kind. There is only 1 queen left, so just one of those circumstances, and there are 47 cards, so 47 possible circumstances. the probability of getting a four-of-a-kind is $P_{four-of-a-kind}=\frac{1}{47}$
\newline
Thus, the final probability is: 
\newline 
P(draws to full house or four-of-a-kind)$=P_{full-house} + P_{four-of-a-kind}$
\newline
P(draws to full house or four-of-a-kind)$=\frac{3}{47}+\frac{1}{47}=\frac{4}{47}$


\subsection*{Question 5, Section 2, Chapter 2 (\cite{boyce11th})}

\noindent\textbf{Assigned to Dariya Kalymova}\\

\noindent A bridge hand (thirteen cards) is dealt from a stan dard 52-card deck. Let A be the event that the hand contains four aces; let B be the event that the hand contains four kings. Find
\begin{math}
 P(A \cup B).
 \end{math}
\newline
\textit{\textbf{Solution:}}
\begin{math}
 P(A) = \frac{\binom{4}{4} \binom{48}{9}}{\binom{52}{13}}.\newline 
  P(B) = \frac{\binom{4}{4} \binom{48}{9}}{\binom{52}{13}}.\newline
   P(A \cap B) = \frac{\binom{4}{4} \binom{4}{4} \binom{44}{5}}{\binom{52}{13}}.\newline
  P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)- P(A \cap B) = \frac{4 669 920}{1512}
\end{math}
